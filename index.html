	<h1>Preamble</h1>
  
  <p>
		Who are “we”?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		Who are we addressing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		On whose behalf?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		For what purpose?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		With what effect?
    - Beginning of a conversation between different agents about human rights online<br>
    - Promote a practice of awareness & conciousness <br>
    - Propose online rights, keeping offline rights in mind <br>
    - Spark creativty <br>
    - Create a form of accountability & transparency <br>
  </p>
  <p>
		On what authority?
    - We are not interacting with the internet conciously 
    	(privacy issues, environmental conseqences) <br>
    - We are aware of these issues and hope to create a better future <br>
    - No one really has authority... <br>
    - And these are standard rather than enforced laws <br>
    - Open source means inclusivity <br>
    - While everyone's opinion is valid, we recognize that those who are comfortable
     	with the internet will be the ones largely represented <br>
    - We do not hold a universal perspective, therefore these are not universal rights <br>
    - We resign authority -> We are biased, though recall the section above <br>
    - We have the authority to think creatively and with agency <br>
    - ... Circular arguement 😅😅😅 <br>
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Notes:<br>
    - Because of the format of our document, we acknowledge that those 
    	who currently do not have access to the digital resources may not
    	be able to participate in this discussion. <br>
    - And we do realize that everyone has a equal right to digital resources. <br>
    - Though, this does not mean equal participation <br>
