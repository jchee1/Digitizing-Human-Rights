		Who are “we”?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We are a group of engaged students 
    who's generation has experienced 
    never ending integration between our 
    online and offline privacies
  </p>
  
  <p>
		Who are we addressing?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		On whose behalf?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On behalf of the American population 
    who uses the internet. We chose only to for US as there are many
    cultural and judicial differences between countries. We can
    only speak on behalf of our experience. Different
    governments would have different policies on internet usage.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
		For what purpose?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		With what effect?
  </p>
  
  <p>
		On what authority?
  </p>
