  <p>
    For what purpose?
  </p>

  <ol class="yuh">
    We write this document for the purpose of maximizing the good and minimizing the harm arising from global, interconnected digital systems, illustrated in the following but not exhaustive list:
    <li>The benefits of such systems are distributed equitably among all its direct and indirect participants as opposed to being concentrated among the hands of the powerful, rich, or influential. </li>
    <li>Human rights in the offline world are adequately protected online as often digital actions affect the material non-digital world. However, we recognize that the digital realm continuously introduces new phenomena that will reshape existing understandings of all human rights.</li>
    <li> Digital freedoms are ensured for all that may be affected whatsoever by the ever-expanding digital world.</li>
    <li>Protection from harmful manifestations of digital power given existing imbalances in power and freedoms manifested from the physical world.</li>
  </ol <p>
  With what effect?
